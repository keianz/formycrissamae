I know you have been very tired and busy since you already have work but I hope you don't forget to rest. I may have been not so sweet or may have not been checking you from time to time but I do worry about you and think of you. Don't forget to rest and take a break. I know there are some things you are not able to share with me or tell me and it is okay, just know that I'm always here. I'll give you hugs or kiss. Please do know that you are still doing great even on the times that you feel like you are not doing great at all. I admire every single detail about you, even the ones that I don't get to notice. I love you, always."</p>
